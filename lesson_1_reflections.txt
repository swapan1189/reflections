How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It wasnt very helpful

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It could take me back to older versions to code checking

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
We have lot of flexibility with this.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because multiple files sometimes are inteconnected.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
with git log I can view all the commit ids.
With git diff I can see the lines removed and added. I have to use like git diff idolder idnewer.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I can checkout the code which was error free so there would not be any issues. I can also find out first commit id which caused the bug by comparing with last correct working commit to see which code made the issue exist.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
For my machine learning projects
